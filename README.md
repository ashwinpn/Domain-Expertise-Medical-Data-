## Week 1 Notes 

1] Reducing Medical Errors - Focus on <ins>model performance</ins> [how that translates to real world scenarios] rather than just model accuracy.

2] In the US, the most common causes of death are - Heart disease, Cancer [Both account for >30% of the deaths in the states].

3] Cancer cells burn sugar quite a lot [Thus, using this causal effect we can detect cancer cells by detecting parts of the body with high sugar depletion rate]. 

4] Alzheimerâ€™s - have chemical trackers for processing.

5] Invasive - Surgery involved, Non-Invasive - No surgery, only (say) scanning.

6] EHR data needs to be processed as Time Series Data [Hence, Forward Chaining,  not K-fold cross validation].

Q1] Representation Learning - How do we go from these diverse modalities to an outcome. Also, Functional Forms - which form of the data would be the most optimal for the learning process.

Q2] Bias in data - think deeply about the data-collection criteria.
